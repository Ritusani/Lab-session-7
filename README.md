# "The financial markets punish security breaches or not?‚Äù

With the help of the analysis that I did for the last lab session and reasearch for this lab session, I found out that **stock price dip is a short term thing** for all the companies. 

Companies face a dip but usually after that these companies put a lot of time and effort so that they don't suffer much financially. They face a lot of criticism and loss of trust. However, as companies work on their public image and reputation, the effect is dilutes in the long term. Hence using the word punishment will be extreme since **punishments usually have drastic and long term effects**. 

### Visualization of Last lab session (lab 3) -

This visualization shows the dip but the measure is too wide for the purpose. Considering the fact that Stock prices change every minute. Hence, I decided to change my approach for this lab session. 

#### Problems with the old visualizationa and data used:

1. I used years to show how average price of companies is changing which suffered a data breach around the same year. 

2. The average went down but I can't strongly say that it went down around the same time as the data breach. Hence, wrong time frame. 

3. I am comparing two companies only hence the general argument gets weekened. This might not be the case for every company. In fact when I actually tried to search the data on NASDAQ, I found the stock price hardly changes. 

## How can this be improved ?

### 1. Data:
First and foremost is the proper data need. I need  data for everyday for the month when the company suffered the breach and a few days after that month. Comparing 

### 2.
